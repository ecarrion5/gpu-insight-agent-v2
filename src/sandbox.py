"""Safe execution of LLM-generated pandas code.

This is the heart of the "fingers on the keyboard" story. NEVER exec() model output
in your own process. Here I use defense in depth:

  1. AST validation BEFORE running anything: reject imports, dunder access, and
     dangerous builtin names. Fail fast, cheaply, without executing.
  2. Execution in a SEPARATE process with a hard timeout: a runaway or infinite loop
     gets terminated, and a crash can't take down the agent.
  3. A restricted namespace: the code sees only pandas (pd), numpy (np), the dataframe
     (df), and a small allow-list of safe builtins. No open(), no __import__.

Honest caveat (say this in the interview): this is a PROTOTYPE-grade sandbox, good
enough for our own model's output. It is not a hardened boundary for adversarial code.
In production I'd run untrusted code in a container with no network, a read-only
filesystem, seccomp, and cgroup CPU/memory limits — or a hosted code-interpreter
sandbox — and pass the worker a data path rather than pickling the whole frame.
