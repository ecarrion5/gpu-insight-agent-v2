"""Pydantic schemas: the structured-output contract the LLM must satisfy.

Main points:
This is how I enforce that an LLM's free-text output becomes a validated, 
machine-readable object. If the model returns something malformed, the
constructor raises the ValidationError and the agent loop re-prompts (see agent.py).
Same technique I used in Thematica between the coding/theming/insight stages.
